Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp – Project 4

Group Members: Jason Crespo, Noah Welgoss, Daniel Abrego

Data Science Model: Bitcoin Price Analysis

Objective: Utilize variables such as BTC Historical Price Data , M2 Money Supply, and Social Media Data to deliver multiple layers of predictive modeling of price.Within project four, Jason, Noah and Daniel will explore the relationship between macroeconomic factors, cryptocurrency markets, and social sentiment by using M2 money supply data, Bitcoin (BTC) historical price data, and Twitter sentiment analysis. By leveraging machine learning models, we’ll analyze how changes in the M2 money supply—a measure of the total money available in the economy—correlate with BTC price fluctuations, while incorporating Twitter sentiment as a real-time gauge of market sentiment. The project aims to predict BTC price movements using these inputs, demonstrating the power of machine learning in financial forecasting and sentiment analysis.
